### zipkin 

If trace IDs in the log files are not enough, you can perform a more sophisticated trace analysis by using Zipkin. Zipkin is an application that collects tracing data and displays detailed data about it in a web UI. This data contains the duration of the single steps between services among a lot of other things.
